What is it?
-----------

StayAwake is a small application for Windows, which allows to temporarily disable the screensaver, sleep, hibernation and anything else that is launched when the computer is idle.

StayAwake can be useful if you want to watch a movie and you have to move the mouse every few minutes to avoid the screensaver. It can also help if you would like to disable the screensaver, but you can�t because of some sort of security policy.


How does it work?
-----------------

StayAwake tries to fool Windows that there is a user moving the mouse cursor all the time. To acomplish this StayAwake sens out notification about a zero pixel mouse move every few seconds. This allows to avoid the screensaver without moving the mouse around.
